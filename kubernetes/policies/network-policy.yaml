# Explanation:
# Purpose:
# Restricts traffic to and from Pods with the label app: my-app.
# Only allows traffic on port 80 (e.g., HTTP traffic).

# Key Sections:
# podSelector: Specifies the Pods the policy applies to.
# ingress: Controls incoming traffic to the selected Pods.
# egress: Controls outgoing traffic from the selected Pods.

# How It Works:
# Only Pods with the label app: my-app can communicate with each other on port 80.
# All other traffic is denied by default.
